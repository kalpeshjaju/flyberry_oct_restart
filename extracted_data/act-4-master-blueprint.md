## CONTENT FRAMEWORK

### **1. HYPOTHESIS-TEST-CONCLUSION**
Every validation follows scientific method:

**Structure**:
```
HYPOTHESIS: Premium positioning (₹3,000/kg) is justified by quality
TEST: Blind taste test (50 customers, vs Happilo/Farmley)
RESULTS: 82% preferred Flyberry, 76% would pay ₹2,500-3,500
CONCLUSION: Premium pricing validated IF quality story told effectively
```

### **2. EVIDENCE STANDARDS**
- Quantitative proof (numbers, %, benchmarks)
- Comparative proof (vs named competitors)
- Third-party validation (external sources)
- Customer proof (quotes, behavior data)

### **3. RISK ASSESSMENT**
For every validated hypothesis:
- What could go wrong
- Probability of failure
- Mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### **Specificity Requirements**
- ✅ "82% taste preference vs Happilo (n=50, blind test)"
- ✅ "Goldman Sachs repeated orders 15× (proof of consistency)"
- ✅ "Cold chain maintains 5-10°C origin to door (vs competitor room temp)"
- ❌ "Customers prefer our quality"
- ❌ "Corporate clients validate us"
- ❌ "Cold chain makes difference"

### **Evidence Hierarchy**
1. **Experimental Data** (controlled tests, A/B tests)
2. **Behavioral Data** (repeat rates, purchase patterns)
3. **Customer Feedback** (ratings, reviews, surveys)
4. **Market Benchmarks** (industry standards, competitor data)

## DATA SOURCES

### **Primary Sources**
- Taste test results (need to conduct/extract)
- corporate-clients.json (client list, repeat orders)

- Competitive quality comparison (lab tests)
- Market readiness surveys (consumer sentiment)
