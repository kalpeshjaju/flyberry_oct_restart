## CONTENT FRAMEWORK (Applied to ALL Documents)

### **1. PYRAMID PRINCIPLE** (Barbara Minto)
Start with answer, then support with evidence.

**Structure for Every Section**:
```
ANSWER FIRST (Core insight in 2 sentences)
  ↓
LAYER 1: Factual Evidence (data, origins, specifications)
  ↓
LAYER 2: Validation/Proof (Fortune 500, RDA%, lab-tested)
  ↓
LAYER 3: Customer Implication ("What this means", "What you taste")
  ↓
BRIDGE: Transition to next section
```

**Example**:
- ANSWER: "We curate the world's finest from 11 countries"
- EVIDENCE: Jordan Valley dates, Amazonian nuts, Turkish hazelnuts
- VALIDATION: Fortune 500 trust, top export grades only
- IMPLICATION: You taste caramel notes (Kalmi), buttery richness (Macadamia)
- BRIDGE: "Now let's explore our 2 hero products..."

### **2. MECE FRAMEWORK** (McKinsey)
Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive.

**Applied to Documents**:
- Doc 00: Brand Foundation (mission, vision, positioning)
- Doc 01: Product Portfolio (what we sell)
- Doc 02: Sourcing Philosophy (how we source)
- Doc 03: Hero Products (standout examples)
- Doc 04: Nutritional Excellence (why nutritionally superior)
- Doc 05: Fortune 500 Validation (trust proof)
- Doc 06: Brand Promise (what we guarantee)

**No Overlap**: Each document covers distinct dimension.
**Complete Coverage**: Together, they cover ALL "who we are" dimensions.

### **3. SO WHAT? TEST** (Journalism)
Every fact must answer "Why does this matter?"

**Template**:
```
FACT: "We source from 11 countries"
  ↓ SO WHAT?
BENEFIT: "Enables best-in-class across ALL categories"
  ↓ SO WHAT?
OUTCOME: "You get one-stop gourmet destination"
```

**Applied to Every Claim**:
- After every fact → add "What this means" or "Why this matters"
- Translate features into benefits
- Show customer impact

### **4. CONFIDENCE HIERARCHY** (Academic Research)
Claims proportional to evidence strength.

**Confidence Levels**:
- **100%**: Lab-tested data (254.5% selenium RDA, nutritional profiles)
- **95%**: Verified sourcing (11 countries, top export grades)
- **90%**: Corporate clients (50+ Fortune 500 - verified relationships)
- **85%**: Operational claims (20× fewer complaints - customer feedback based)

**At End of Each Document**:
```
**Data Sources**: [Specific files]
**Confidence**: [XX]% ([reasoning])
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```
