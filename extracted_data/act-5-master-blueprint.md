## CONTENT FRAMEWORK

### **1. EVIDENCE-BASED PRESCRIPTION**
Every recommendation traces back to Acts 1-4:

**Structure**:
```
RECOMMENDATION: Reposition as ultra-premium (₹3,000-5,000/kg tier)
EVIDENCE BASE:
  - Act 1: Quality standards (top export grades, cold chain)
  - Act 2: Current pricing ₹2,500-3,500 undervalues quality
  - Act 3: Customer insight - 76% would pay ₹3,000+ for story + quality
  - Act 4: Validated through taste tests, Fortune 500 proof
IMPLEMENTATION: Packaging redesign, messaging shift, channel focus
```

### **2. ROADMAP STRUCTURE**
Every initiative has:
- **What**: Clear deliverable
- **Why**: Strategic rationale (links to Acts 1-4)
- **When**: Quarter, week, sprint
- **Who**: Owner, team
- **How Much**: Investment required
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcome

### **3. RISK MITIGATION**
For every major bet:
- What could go wrong
- Probability (high/med/low)
- Impact (₹, %, strategic)
- Mitigation plan
- Contingency plan
