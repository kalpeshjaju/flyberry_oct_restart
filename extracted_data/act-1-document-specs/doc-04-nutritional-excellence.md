**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Read Time**: 6 minutes

---

## PURPOSE

Evidence-based nutritional superiority showcasing top highlights across portfolio, FSSAI-compliant claims, and health benefit mapping.

This document **proves nutritional value with data** - not marketing fluff, actual RDA percentages.

---

## DATA SOURCES

**Primary**:
- `products/*.json` (nutritional benefits with RDA percentages from all 13 products)
- `claims/claims-registry.json` (30 health claims, 78 unique claim types)

**Validation**:
- All RDA percentages lab-tested (FSSAI compliance)
- All claims FSSAI-approved (regulatory compliance)

---

## SECTION STRUCTURE

### **Section 1: NUTRITIONAL PHILOSOPHY**
**Purpose**: Establish approach to nutrition claims

**Content Template**:
```markdown
## NUTRITIONAL PHILOSOPHY

**"We let the data speak - not marketing hype."**

### Our Approach

**What You See on Our Packages**:
- **254.5% RDA Selenium** (Brazil Nuts) - not "high in selenium"
- **68.5% RDA Manganese** (Pine Nuts) - not "rich in minerals"
- **45.3% RDA Vitamin E** (Hazelnuts) - not "antioxidant-rich"

**Why Specificity Matters**:
- "High in" could mean 5% RDA or 50% RDA (meaningless without number)
- Specific percentages = you make informed choices
- Lab-tested data = trust, not guesswork

### FSSAI Compliance

**Every nutritional claim**:
- ✅ Lab-tested (third-party verification)
- ✅ FSSAI-approved language (regulatory compliance)
- ✅ Sourced from official databases (not estimated)
- ✅ Based on 28g serving size (standardized measurement)

**Result**: You can trust our numbers.
```

**Requirements**:
- Open with quotable philosophy
- Give 3 specific examples (product + nutrient + exact RDA%)
- Contrast specific vs vague ("254.5%" vs "high in")
- Explain FSSAI compliance (builds trust)

### **Section 2: TOP 11 NUTRITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS**
**Purpose**: Showcase portfolio's strongest nutritional features

**Content Template**:
```markdown
## TOP 11 NUTRITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
**Ranked by RDA Percentage (Highest to Lowest)**

{Generate from nutritional_highlights sorted by rdaPercent descending, take top 11}

### **#1: {product} - {nutrient}** ({rdaPercent}% RDA)
**The Claim**: {claim}

**Why This Matters**:
{Map nutrient to health benefit}
- {Primary benefit}
- {Secondary benefit}
- {Additional context}

**Sourcing Context**: {origin} {if special growing conditions, include}

**How to Consume**:
- Serving size: {calculate based on RDA%}
- Best consumed: {timing/pairing suggestion}

---

### **#2: {product} - {nutrient}** ({rdaPercent}% RDA)
{Repeat structure for each of top 11}

---
```

**Requirements**:
- Extract ALL nutritional highlights with RDA >= 20% from all products
- Sort by rdaPercent descending (highest first)
- Take top 11 (covers major nutrients across portfolio)
- For each highlight:
  - State exact RDA percentage
  - Explain health benefit (SO WHAT test)
  - Include sourcing context
  - Add consumption guidance
- Map nutrients to health benefits:
  - Selenium → Thyroid, immunity, antioxidant
  - Manganese → Bone health, metabolism
  - Vitamin E → Antioxidant, skin health
  - Magnesium → Muscle function, energy
  - Phosphorus → Bone health
  - Copper → Immune system, iron absorption
  - Natural sugars → Quick energy (dates)

---

### **Section 3: DETAILED NUTRIENT PROFILES**
**Purpose**: Group products by nutritional focus

**Content Template**:
```markdown
## DETAILED NUTRIENT PROFILES

**Our 13 products organized by nutritional strength**:

### **Selenium Powerhouses**
{Filter products where selenium RDA >= 20%}
- **{product}**: {selenium_rda}% RDA - {benefit}

### **Manganese Champions**
{Filter products where manganese RDA >= 20%}
- **{product}**: {manganese_rda}% RDA - {benefit}

### **Vitamin E Leaders**
{Filter products where vitamin_e RDA >= 20%}
- **{product}**: {vitamin_e_rda}% RDA - {benefit}

### **Magnesium Sources**
{Filter products where magnesium RDA >= 20%}
- **{product}**: {magnesium_rda}% RDA - {benefit}

### **Natural Energy (Dates)**
{List all date products}
- Natural sugars (fructose + glucose) for sustained energy
- No added sugars, no preservatives
- Fiber for gradual release

### **Multi-Nutrient Profiles**
**Products delivering 3+ nutrients at >20% RDA**:
{Filter products with 3 or more benefits where rdaPercent >= 20%}
- **{product}**: {list all nutrients with RDA >= 20%}
```

**Requirements**:
- Group products by dominant nutrient
- Only include products where that nutrient >= 20% RDA
- Identify "multi-nutrient" products (3+ nutrients >= 20% RDA)
- Show dates as "natural energy" category (unique positioning)

---

### **Section 4: FSSAI STANDARDS & COMPLIANCE**
**Purpose**: Show regulatory rigor

**Content Template**:
```markdown
## FSSAI STANDARDS & COMPLIANCE

**Every nutritional claim on our packages complies with FSSAI regulations.**

### **What This Means**

**"Source of" Nutrient** (FSSAI Definition):
- Must provide **at least 10% RDA** per serving
- We meet this for all claimed nutrients

**"Good Source of" Nutrient** (FSSAI Definition):
- Must provide **at least 20% RDA** per serving
- We highlight only nutrients meeting this threshold

**"Excellent Source of" Nutrient** (FSSAI Definition):
- Must provide **at least 30% RDA** per serving
- Example: Brazil Nuts - 254.5% selenium (far exceeds threshold)

### **Our Labeling Standards**

**We Go Beyond Minimum**:
- FSSAI requires 20% for "good source" → We show exact percentage (e.g., 254.5%)
- FSSAI allows estimated values → We use lab-tested data
- FSSAI permits generic claims → We use specific numbers

**Third-Party Verification**:
- All nutritional data lab-tested by FSSAI-certified labs
- Test reports available upon request
- Batch testing for consistency verification

### **Compliance Certifications**

- ✅ FSSAI License (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India)
- ✅ HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points)
- ✅ ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management)
- ✅ FSSC Stage One audit completed (full certification Q2 FY26)
```

**Requirements**:
- Explain FSSAI thresholds (10%, 20%, 30%)
- Show how we exceed standards (exact numbers vs vague claims)
- List all certifications
- Mention lab testing and third-party verification
