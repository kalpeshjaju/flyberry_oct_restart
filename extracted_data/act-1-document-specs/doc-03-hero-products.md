## HERO #1: BRAZIL NUTS

### **Why This Matters**

**Selenium's Role**:
- Thyroid function regulation

- Immune system support
- DNA synthesis

**The Rarity**:
- No other food delivers this much selenium naturally

**Sourcing Story**:
- **Origin**: {product.origin}
- **Harvest Method**: Wild-harvested from Amazon rainforest (not farmed)
- **Why Wild-Harvested**: Amazonian soil is selenium-rich (geological advantage)
- **Grading**: Large whole kernels only (not broken pieces)

### **Taste Profile**

**Characteristics**: {product.characteristics}

**Flavor Notes**:
- Creamy texture (higher fat content than other nuts)
- Mild, earthy sweetness (not bitter like some nuts)
- Buttery finish

**Best Consumed**:

- 2 nuts per day (optimal selenium intake, more may exceed UL)
