## CONTENT FRAMEWORK (Applied to ALL Documents)

### **1. BRUTAL HONESTY PRINCIPLE**
This is NOT a sales deck. This is internal assessment.

**Rules**:
- State problems clearly (no euphemisms)
- Show data (no hand-waving)
- Admit failures (no spin)
- Challenge assumptions (no sacred cows)

**Example**:
- ❌ BAD: "We're exploring new packaging designs"
- ✅ GOOD: "Current packaging looks mid-market (₹200/kg visual) despite ₹3,000/kg product inside. 67% of taste testers assumed price was ₹400-600 before reveal."

### **2. DATA-FIRST STRUCTURE**
Start with numbers, then interpretation.

**Structure for Every Section**:
```
DATA (Revenue, %, metrics, quotes)
  ↓
WHAT THIS MEANS (Interpretation, so what)
  ↓
WHY IT MATTERS (Strategic implications)
  ↓
WHAT WE NEED TO DO (Action implications)
```

### **3. COMPARATIVE CONTEXT**
Everything relative to:
- Previous periods (YoY, QoQ)
- Competitors (Happilo, Farmley, Bateel)
- Industry benchmarks (repeat rates, AOV, CAC)

### **4. PROBLEM-SOLUTION BALANCE**
For every problem identified:
- Root cause diagnosis
- Impact quantification
- Potential solutions (preview, detailed in Act 5)

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### **Specificity Requirements**
- ✅ "₹9.7 Cr Q1 FY26 revenue (+32% YoY)"
- ✅ "46% repeat rate on Medjoul dates"
- ✅ "90% YoY volume growth on Swiggy Instamart"
- ❌ "Strong revenue growth"
- ❌ "High customer retention"
- ❌ "Significant e-commerce expansion"

### **Evidence Hierarchy**
1. **Quantitative Data** (revenue, %, counts)
2. **Customer Quotes** (verbatim feedback)
3. **Competitive Benchmarks** (vs named competitors)
4. **Market Research** (third-party validation)

### **Tone Guidelines**
- **Objective**: Data-driven, not emotional
- **Direct**: Call out problems clearly
- **Constructive**: Every criticism → path forward
- **Urgent**: ₹100 Cr goal creates time pressure

## DOCUMENT INTERDEPENDENCIES

**Act 2 Structure Flow**:
```
Doc 00: Where we are (baseline data)
  ↓
Doc 01: Positioning gap (perception vs reality)
  ↓
Doc 02: What's working (strengths to build on)
  ↓
Doc 03: What's broken (problems to fix)
  ↓
Doc 04: Competitive reality (external context)
  ↓
Doc 05: ₹100 Cr blockers (strategic challenges)
```

**Cross-Act Dependencies**:
- Act 1 (WHO WE ARE) → Establishes brand promise
- Act 2 (WHERE WE ARE) → Shows current vs promise gap
- Act 3 (DISCOVERIES) → Explains why gaps exist
- Act 4 (MARKET PROOF) → Validates assumptions about gaps
- Act 5 (WHERE TO GO) → Prescribes solutions

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
