## HOW SPECS WORK

Each spec file defines:
1. **Purpose**: What this document achieves
2. **Data Sources**: Where content comes from
3. **Section Structure**: Exact sections and order
4. **Content Templates**: Markdown format with placeholders
5. **Requirements**: What must be included
6. **Quality Checklist**: Validation criteria
