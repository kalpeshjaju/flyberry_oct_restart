## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES (Applied Across All Acts)

### **1. Data-Driven**
- Every claim backed by data
- All numbers sourced and dated
- No generic statements allowed

### **2. MECE Framework**
- Documents mutually exclusive (no overlap)
- Collectively exhaustive (complete coverage)
- Clear logical flow between documents

### **3. Evidence Hierarchy**
1. Quantitative data (revenue, %, metrics)
2. Behavioral data (repeat rates, purchase patterns)
3. Qualitative data (customer quotes, feedback)
4. Market research (third-party validation)

### **4. Quality Standards**
- **Depth Score**: 85-92/100 (Act-specific targets)
- **Specificity Ratio**: 92-95% (minimize generic claims)
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims traced to sources
- **Actionable**: Clear implications, next steps

---

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Next**: Phase 2 - Migrate Act 2 to spec-driven architecture
**Timeline**: Starting immediately, target 1-day completion
