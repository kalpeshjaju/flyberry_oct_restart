## CONTENT FRAMEWORK

### **1. INSIGHT STRUCTURE**
Every insight follows: Observation → Evidence → Implication → Opportunity

**Example**:
```
OBSERVATION: Fortune 500 clients buy Flyberry for gifting, not personal consumption
EVIDENCE: 95% of corporate orders are Diwali/NY gifts, 0% recurring pantry orders
IMPLICATION: Missing ₹X Cr year-round B2B snack market
OPPORTUNITY: Pivot corporate positioning from "gifting only" to "wellness snacking"
```

### **2. CONFIDENCE SCORING**
Every major claim rated:
- **95%+**: Quantitative data, large sample
- **85-94%**: Mixed data, moderate sample
- **70-84%**: Qualitative signals, small sample
- **<70%**: Hypothesis, needs validation

### **3. OPPORTUNITY SIZING**
Every opportunity quantified:
- Market size (₹ TAM)
- Flyberry potential (realistic capture)
- Timeline (when addressable)
- Investment required
